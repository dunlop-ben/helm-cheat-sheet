# What is Helm?

Helm is a package managher for Kubernetes. Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.


## Terminology

#### Chart

A chart is a Helm package and collection of YAML files that describe Kubernetes resources. It contains all the configuration to run an application or service.

#### Manifest

A manifest is a YAML-encoded representation of the Kubernetes resources that were generated from a release's chart.

#### Release

A release is an instance of a Helm chart running in a cluster. Installing a chart into a cluster will create a release.

## Helm Commands

#### helm list

Lists all of the releases for a specified namespace (uses current namespace context if namespace not specified).

`helm list`

Example: `helm list -n foo`

#### helm install

Install a package (Helm chart).

`helm install [RELEASE NAME] [REPOSITORY NAME]/[CHART NAME]`
`helm install [RELEASE NAME] [PATH TO CHART DIRECTORY]`
`helm install [RELEASE NAME] .` Command when executing from within the chart directory

To override values in a chart, use either the '--values' flag and pass in a file or use the '--set' flag and pass configuration from the command line.

##### --generate-name

Autogenerate the name (and omit the NAME parameter).

##### --wait

Wait until the release is in a ready state before marking the release as successful.

##### --atomic

Delete the installation and rollback on failure. Useful for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

##### --dry-run

Simulate an install. Load the chart, parse values.yaml, generate manifest and parse YAML Kubernetes object for validation. Does not send Kubernetes objects to Kubernetes. Useful for debugging manifests.

#### helm get manifest

Fetches the generated manifest for a given release at the time of deployment.

`helm get manifest [RELEASE NAME]`

`kubectl` can be used to fetch what is in Kubernetes at the present time.

Example: `kubectl get deployments [DEPLOYMENT NAME] -o yaml`

#### helm create

Create a new chart with a specified name (creates an NGINX chart by default).

`helm create [CHART NAME]`

#### helm lint

`helm template [PATH TO CHART DIRECTORY]`

Runs a series of tests to verify that the chart is well-formed. Examine a chart for possible issues.

#### helm template

Locally render template. Does not send Kubernetes objects to Kubernetes or parse for validation. Useful for reviewing template and debugging syntatical errors.

`helm template [PATH TO CHART DIRECTORY]`

#### helm upgrade

Upgrade a release with a new version of a chart.

`helm upgrade [RELEASE NAME]'

##### --install

If a release by this name doesn't already exist, install first. Useful for continuous integration and continuous deployment as a package will first be installed.

##### --cleanup-on-failure

Delete new resources created in this upgrade when upgrade fails. Can hinder debugging when an upgrade fails.

#### helm uninstall

`helm uninstall [RELEASE NAME]'

##### --keep-history

Remove all associated resources and mark the release as deleted, but retain the release history.

## Repositories

A chart repository is a web server that houses packaged charts which can be discovered and shared. A chart repository includes an `index.html` file that contains information about each chart in a repository.

#### helm repo add

Add and store a chart repository locally.

`helm repo add [NAME] [URL]`

Example: `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

#### helm repo list

List locally stored charts.

`helm repo list`

#### helm repo remove

Remove a locally stored chart repository.

`helm repo remove [NAME]`

Example: `helm repo remove bitnami`

#### helm repo update

Get and update the locally stored chart repositories from their respective remote chart repository.

`helm repo update`

#### helm pull

Download a specified chart from a repository.

`helm pull [URL]/[NAME]`

#### helm package

Package a chart directory into a chart archive (creates a `tgz` file).

The name of the archived chart is derived from the `name` property in the Chart.yaml file.

`helm package [PATH]`

A chart can be packaged and written to a specified local destination.

`helm package [PATH] -d [DESTINATION STRING]`

#### .helmignore

The .helmignore file is used to specify files that should not be packaged with a chart.
